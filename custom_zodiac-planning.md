### Assignment Description

Students will create their own custom zodiac web page based upon the Zodiac Algorithm to be delivered online.

- All functional zodiac signs must be displayed as interactive elements that the user can select. When selected, the selected sign will be activated and displayed.
- Each sign must be represented in a unique visual way.
- Each sign when activated must play a unique sound effect.
- This application must have a help screen that clearly defines how the application works.

### What am I doing?

For my project, I'm doing "which basketball player are you". Each zodiac will be represented by a star NBA player who shares the same zodiac sign as the user's input. Here's the specifics for each sign:

| Sign | Player | Quote | Audio |
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Capricorn | LeBron James | You strive for greatness. When all is said and done, the only debate will be whether you’re called "The King" or "The G.O.A.T” | the kid from vine saying "LeBron Jaaaaames"
| Aquarius | Michael Jordan | Everyone wants to be like you. There’s just a certain "air" to you | TBD |
| Pisces | Stephen Curry | The way you play might not be appreciated by old-timers, but the revolution you lead speaks for itself. | Drake saying "I been Steph Curry with the shot" from 0-100 song |
| Aries | Kyrie Irving | You care about legacy and do not want to live in someone else’s shadow | TBD |
| Taurus | Tim Duncan | You understand the importance of fundamentals and it will make you a master of your craft | TBD |
| Gemini | Allen Iverson | You’re a trend-setter. Things you do may seem unorthodox, but people will come to love it | "We talkin bout practice?!" sound bite |
| Cancer |  Kawhi Leonard | Some say you’re too quiet & serious: but your laugh is unforgettable | Kawhi Leonard's viral-meme laugh |
| Leo | Wilt Chamberlain | You walk and talk a big game. If others haven’t already seen it, just show them your stat sheet. | TBD |
| Virgo | James Harden | You have an uncanny ability to score. This success could bring plenty of travelling! | TBD |
| Libra | Kevin Durant | You’re one of a kind, but you worry too much about what others think. Be careful on social media! | TBD |
| Scorpio | Russell Westbrook | Loyalty is important to you. You’d rather put the team on your back then take the easy way out, and people respect that. | TBD |
| Sagittarius | Larry Bird | You may not look the part, but there’s no doubt you can compete with the best | TBD |
